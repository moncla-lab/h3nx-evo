LockException:
Error: Directory cannot be locked. Please make sure that no other Snakemake process is trying to create the same files in the following directory:
/Users/monclalab1/Documents/h3nx/h3nx_build/condition_on_ha/analysis/treesort/no-collapse/ha_automate/pipeline/canine_test/build
If you are sure that no other instances of snakemake are running on this directory, the remaining lock was likely caused by a kill signal or a power loss. It can be removed with the --unlock argument.
